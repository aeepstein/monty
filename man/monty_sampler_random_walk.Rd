\title{Random Walk Sampler}
\usage{
monty_sampler_random_walk(vcv = NULL, boundaries = "reflect")
}
\arguments{
\item{vcv}{A variance covariance matrix for the proposal.}

\item{boundaries}{Control the behaviour of proposals that are
outside the model domain.  The supported options are:
\itemize{
\item "reflect" (the default): we reflect proposed parameters that
lie outside the domain back into the domain (as many times as
needed)
\item "reject": we do not evaluate the density function, and return
\code{-Inf} for its density instead.
\item "ignore": evaluate the point anyway, even if it lies outside
the domain.
}

The initial point selected will lie within the domain, as this is
enforced by \link{monty_sample}.}
}
\value{
A \code{monty_sampler} object, which can be used with
\link{monty_sample}
}
\description{
Create a simple random walk sampler, which uses a symmetric
proposal to move around parameter space.  This sampler supports
sampling from models where the likelihood is only computable
randomly (e.g., for pmcmc).
